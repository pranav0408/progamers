                <p>The fourth Modern Warfare game won't have a 4 in the title. That's because 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare isn't a sequel, but a reboot, or as developer Infinity Ward calls it, a "re-imagining" of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series.

                    With this reset of Modern Warfare's storyline, Infinity Ward hopes to create a relevant, realistic world with events that feel "ripped from the headlines" while also bringing back familiar characters from past games in the series like Captain John Price. Unlike Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare will have singleplayer campaign on top of the usual multiplayer modes and co-op missions.
                    
                    Here's everything we know about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</p>
                <h3>What is the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare release date?</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare released globally on October 25, 2019. If you're in North America, it actually came out on October 24.

                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare review
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Modern Warfare is finally out in the wild, and so is our review. We scored it 80 out of 100, which is pretty good in our book. Morgan praised the game for its new weapon handling, campaign, and clever multiplayer modes, but wishes it did more to break away from tradition. "For as far as Modern Warfare moves the needle, it still spends so much energy checking the same old boxes."

                <h3>
                    How does Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's crossplay work?
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare marks the first time the franchise completely supports crossplay for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Since every game handles crossplay a little differently, Infinity Ward took the time to fully explain how it works in Modern Warfare.

                    First of all, crossplay is completely opt-in. If you enable it, you'll need to link a Call of Duty account to form a platform-agnostic friends list, not unlike the Epic friends lists in Fortnite. Crossplay is supported in all multiplayer modes except Ranked and competitive tournaments.

                    In the pre-game lobby, every players' current control scheme (controller or mouse and keyboard) is shown next to their name. By default, you'll only be matched with the same control type, but you can remove this filter to play with all input methods. Of course, grouping up with a friend using a different control input will also remove this filter.

                    Setting your matchmaking preferences to only allow other keyboard and mouse users doesn't mean you'll only match with PC players, though, as both console versions will fully support keyboard and mouse. Controller users might feel naturally inclined to lock out mouse users with more aim control, but Infinity Ward is confident that Modern Warfare is balanced across all input methods.

                    "Not only have we spent a ton of time balancing and making sure the playing field is level between the control schemes, but also, you know, a ton of surprising user tests where we're looking at high-skill user tests and seeing a mix of those control schemes in the top three every time," production manager Paul Haile said.

                    Crossplay beta tests have gone well so far, it sounds, with a lengthy but not total list of identified issues posted by Infinity Ward.

                <h3>
                    There's a 2v2 mode called Gunfight 
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    A new multiplayer mode called Gunfight pits two teams of two with randomized loadouts against one another on very small maps. So small that you're expected to kill one another in 40 seconds or else the rules change to force your hand. The 40 second mark might bring a capture the flag element or decide a win based on which team has the most health at the end of a timer. There's no reviving or healing in Gunfight so the matches do seem to end prior to the rule shakeup, in Chris's hand-on experience. 

                    In the video we see the Pine, King, and Stack maps. Pine, as you might expect, is set in a forest clearing, and the more obliquely-named King is a warehouse MOUT training site. Stack appears to be a shipping depot.

                    You'll be able to learn more about Gunfight and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's other multiplayer modes during a multiplayer reveal event scheduled for August 1 at 10 AM PT on Twitch.

                <h3>
                    Modern Warfare uses a new engine and supports ray tracing
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Modern Warfare will support DirectX Raytracing (DXR) on PC. And that means we can surmise that Activision and Call of Duty will be working with Nvidia and the GeForce RTX cards to support the feature. Ray tracing will even be used for audio. In a press briefing, Stephen Miller, Audio Director for the game said, "With the weapon reflection system, it uses ray tracing out into the environment and plays three sounds at point of impact. So as you're running around you actually get different sounds constantly as it behaves with the geometry."

                    Supporting DXR means that Activision/Infinity Ward is upgrading the IW engine to support DirectX 12, since that's a requirement for all games that support DXR. We'll have to wait and see how that effects performance once Modern Warfare launches, as traditionally DX12 engines have favored AMD hardware.
